# Monophonic-Synthesiser-Version-1
This project is a monophonic digital synthesiser software based on additive, amplitude modulation, and frequency modulation synthesis.  The additive synthesis is based on the addition of three oscillators, called Oscillator1, Oscillator2, and Oscillator Harmonic. The amplitude modulation consists of a Tremolo effect that modulates the overall signal coming from the addition of the three oscillators. The frequency modulation consists on a Vibrato effect that modulates the same overall signal.  Both effects are based on the modulation of a carrier signal, which is this case is the additive signal, by a sine wave in a range of 0 to 20 Hertz. This modulator sine wave is commonly called LFO.  The software has been created in JUCE and has been designed to be easy to use and understand.  This idea has been carried out with the intention of testing some audio knowledge learned in the past 3 years, placed in the context of a piece of software that with further development could be a claim for the industry and for obtaining employment.
